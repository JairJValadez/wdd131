            <h2>2 Nefi 33:10</h2>
            <p>
                And now, my beloved brethren, and also Jew, and all ye ends of the earth, 
                hearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and if ye believe not in 
                these words believe in Christ. And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will 
                believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ, and he hath given 
                them unto me; and they teach all men that they should do good.

            <p>
                But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good continually;
                wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God, 
                and to serve him, is inspired of God.
